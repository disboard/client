Introduction
---
**[Discord](https://discordapp.com/)** (stylized as **DISCORD**) is a free proprietary VoIP application designed for gaming communities. <br /> Discord runs on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Linux, and in a web browser. 

**[Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)** (formerly known as **Atom Shell**) is an open-source framework developed by GitHub.
<br /> It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using the Node.js runtime and the Chromium web browser. 

**[Asar](https://github.com/electron/asar)** is a simple extensive format, it works like `tar` that concatenates all files together without compression, while having random access support.

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

**[Discord Fusion](https://disboard.github.io/)** is a native add-on for the official Discord application, and provides a high-level, object-oriented, event driven interface for a better user experience. By using Discord Fusion, the VoIP application is internally abstracted in a way that allows end-users to easily add functionality without editing *core* files.
